# README

This is a simple SaaS app i've made using Ruby on Rails by following this course :  https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course 

The multi-tenancy system implemented uses subdomains, therefore when you try it on local be sure to open the app through "lvh.me:3000" instead of "localhost:3000"
